📊 Stock Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

This project implements a serverless, cloud-native pipeline to analyze stock sentiment and visualize it using a Streamlit dashboard deployed via AWS ECS Fargate. The data is collected daily from a stock API, analyzed for sentiment, and stored in Amazon RDS and S3. A Streamlit dashboard allows users to visualize and explore the sentiment trends.
